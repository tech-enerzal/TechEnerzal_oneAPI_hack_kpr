## Problem Statement

Large organizations, such as **Intel** (with 130,000+ employees) and **Walmart** (with over 2.1 million employees), often experience significant strain on their HR and IT support personnel. Managing a vast workforce results in a flood of repetitive employee queries related to HR policies, IT support, company events, and more. These queries not only consume valuable time but also slow down overall productivity. Traditional support systems are becoming inefficient, especially when dealing with such large employee bases, and personalized responses for every employee become an overwhelming challenge. This puts immense pressure on HR and IT departments, resulting in long wait times and decreased employee satisfaction.

## Our Solution

**Tech Enerzal Enterprise Assistant** offers a scalable and customizable organizational chatbot solution designed to streamline and automate HR, IT support, and company event-related queries. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, this solution can automatically respond to a wide array of questions in real-time, significantly reducing the strain on support personnel. Our chatbot is built with the flexibility to be tailored to any organization's specific needs, enabling companies to add or remove features in the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline based on their requirements. With a focus on security, privacy, and seamless integration, **Tech Enerzal** provides an affordable, scalable solution that helps organizations of any size, from startups to global enterprises, effectively handle employee queries without compromising on efficiency or data protection.

## Technical Implementation

On the technical front, **Tech Enerzal** integrates **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** and **RAG** to provide real-time responses to employee queries. The solution supports personalized interactions through **employee dashboard integration**, which retrieves relevant data for each employeeâ€™s query dynamically using **real-time function calls**. The chatbot is further enhanced by a **graph-based RAG pipeline**, continuously updated via automated scraping of internal documents, websites, and social profiles. Additionally, we offer document processing features where employees can upload documents (PDF, DOCX) for secure summarization, and access is managed through the **employee login system**. For security, we use open-source technologies without relying on third-party APIs, and **2FA (TOTP)** is implemented for secure logins. The solution can be deployed on **local infrastructure** for high-security use cases or **cloud computing** for lower-security applications, with response times of 4-8 seconds.
